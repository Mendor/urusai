Urusai 0.0.3-dev
================

Jabber (XMPP) bot with extendability using Python plugins.


Software requirements
---------------------

  * **Erlang R16B** or newer
  * **Python 2.7.x**
  * **autotools** and **rebar** for building


External dependencies
---------------------

  * [exmpp](https://github.com/processone/exmpp)
  * [erlport](https://github.com/hdima/erlport)
  * [pooler](https://github.com/seth/pooler)
  * [lager](https://github.com/basho/lager)
  * [cowboy](https://github.com/extend/cowboy)
  * [jsonx](https://github.com/iskra/jsonx)
  * [eredis](https://github.com/wooga/eredis)


Installation
------------

```
git clone https://github.com/Mendor/urusai.git
cd urusai
make deps
make
```


Configuration
-------------

Configuration example can be found in ``default.config.sample``. You may edit this file and rename it to ``default.config`` later or create new configuration file based on this one. [Look inside it](https://github.com/Mendor/urusai/blob/master/default.config.sample) for configuration details.


Running
-------

    ./start.sh default

Where ``default`` is the base name for your configuration (``default.config`` in this case).


Control
-------

Send to the bot subscription from JID set as owner in configuration file. Then you may manage using the following commands:

  * ``ping`` — pong!
  * ``status <YOUR_STATUS_MESSAGE>`` — update status message
  * ``owner list`` — list of bot's owners
  * ``owner add <JID>`` — add <JID> to owners list
  * ``owner del <JID>`` — remove <JID> from owners list (warning: all the owners have the same rights, but the main owner cannot be deleted from the list)
  * ``muc join <MUC_ADDRESS> [<NICK>]`` — join MUC, custom nick may be set on this stage
  * ``muc pjoin <MUC_ADDRESS> <PASSWORD>`` — join password protected MUC
  * ``muc leave <MUC_ADDRESS>`` — leave MUC
  * ``muc nick <MUC_ADDRESS>`` — change bot's shown nick for this MUC
  * ``plugins list`` — list of loaded plugins' triggers information
  * ``plugins reload`` — reload plugins
  * ``exec <COMMAND>`` — execute private message plugin command

After the bot joined MUC, the owners of MUC can manage its behaviour sending private messages inside the room:

  * ``ping`` — guess, what?
  * ``w`` — the name of room you are in
  * ``plugins list`` — get list of loaded plugins and their state
  * ``plugins toggle <PLUGIN>`` — toggle plugin enabled or disabled
  * ``leave`` — force the bot to go out

**Warning:** the plugins are unloaded automatically after plugin module file deletion and reloading plugins by the bot owner or full bot restart, but if you delete a file, reload plugins, put the file back and then reload plugins again, it will become active for all the MUCs it has been active for before deletion.


Plugin API
----------

All the plugins are stored in modules with ``.py`` or ``.pyc`` extension under ``plugins`` directory.

Example of plugin module source code:

```python
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

import urusai_plugin # required for plugin correct work
from datetime import datetime

# Plugin class name should start from 'plugin' and be inherited from
# 'urusai_plugin.Private' class for working with messages sent to
# the bot directly.
class pluginTime(urusai_plugin.Private):
    """
    This plugin class implements replying current time for any user
    sent 'time' string to bot.
    """
    # 'triggers' dict as class property is strongly required.
    # Every key in dict is regular expression (without 'r' prefix!)
    # used for plugin action triggering, and every value is the name
    # of method running when key regexp triggered.
    triggers = { "^time": "Time" }

    # Trigger method name should start from 'trigger' and being
    # preceded by '@staticmethod' decorator.
    # Trigger method should has three parameters:
    #   1st — JID or conference JID/nickname of message sender
    #   2nd — real JID of sender (used only for MUC plugins)
    #   3rd — origin message body
    # Method should return string with the message which will be
    # send back to the user or MUC.
    @staticmethod
    def triggerTime(fromName, fromJid, message):
        return str(datetime.now())

# Inheritance from 'urusai_plugin.MucMessage' is used for plugins
# that may be triggered from MUC chats. All other information about
# 'triggers' property and writing methods is the same.
class pluginTimeChat(urusai_plugin.MucMessage):
    triggers = { "^time": "Time" }

    @staticmethod
    def triggerTime(fromName, fromJid, message):
        return str(datetime.now())

```

All other classes and methods inside modules are not parsed and may be used for coding convenience.

**Plugin method execution time is limited to 60 seconds.**

More plugin examples are available under [``plugins`` directory](https://github.com/Mendor/urusai/tree/master/plugins) of this repo.


HTTP API
--------

Allows sending messages via bot from outer world. The default API URL is [http://localhost:8011/api](http://localhost:8011/api), port and location could be changed via configuration file.

To send private message via bot you should send the following JSON in POST request body:

```javascript
{"type":   "message",
 "target": "victim@jabber.org",
 "body":   "Hello from HTTP API"}
```

If you're sending valid JSON, you will receive:

```javascript
{"result":"ok","message":"sent"}
```

Otherwise the result will be ``"error"`` with the details in ``"message"`` field.

**Allowed types:**

  * ``message`` for direct message sending
  * ``plugin`` to pass message body via plugin mechanism

**Allowed targets:**

  * ``jid@server.org`` — send message directly to this JID
  * ``room@conference.server.org`` — send message to MUC (if you're sending ``plugin`` typed message to MUC, MUC plugins will be applied); you should be joined MUC to send messages there
  * ``room@conference.server.org/Interlocutor`` — send private message to user Interlocutor from MUC room@


TODO
----

  * MUC autorejoin
  * MUC presence plugins API
  * IQ handler
  * more features for plugin returning values
